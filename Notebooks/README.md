# Notebooks overview

## Original notebooks

1. Inception_Pasquet

    Main notebook with the inception model organised in 3 parts : 
        - Regular Training
        - Training with an additional feature, reddening
        - Using the model to output distribution and not only point estimates
    
    For the moment, the most important is the vanila training from part one.
    

2. Image_to_pz_CNNS
    
    Notebook that summs up the results from training with CNN, ResNet and Densenet. 
    None of these models would be deployed but they represent a good point of comparaison.

3. Torch-ViT
    
    Same as 2. Just a comparaison to see how transformers perfom. 
    

## Development stage 1

The run_notebook is the first step of using the functions from the run.py file that modularizes the code from the main notebook Inception_Pasquet.ipynb.
